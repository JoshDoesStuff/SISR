# SISR ✂️

**S**team **I**nput **S**ystem **R**edirector

SISR (pronounced "scissor") redirects Steam Input configurations to the system level (localhost or network).  

SISR takes controllers it receives from Steam (via Steam Input)
and forwards them as emulated but more compatible controllers (indistinguishable from real hardware) to the OS.

It can be used to circumvent issues with games and applications that
do not support Steam Input or otherwise pose challenges, like (but not limited to):

- Games with aggressive anti-cheat systems
- Emulators
- Windows Store games/apps
- Games with broken Steam Input support

All while still providing you the full feature set of SteamInput!

SISR can also be used to "tunnel"/forward Steam Input configurations over the network to other machines, including Keyboard/Mouse.  
This makes it possible to use devices like a Steam Deck as a dedicated controller without the need to stream the entire game.

The emulated controllers (and Keyboard/Mouse) are indistinguishable from real hardware and show up at system level.  
SISR achieves this by utilizing [VIIPER](https://github.com/Alia5/VIIPER) (requires **USBIP**).  
Unlike its predecessor [GlosSI](https://github.com/Alia5/GlosSI), it does not use the unmaintained [ViGEm](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus) driver.

> [!WARNING]
**Highly experimental work in progress.** Everything is subject to change and may or may not work.  
Expect bugs, crashes, and missing features.

> [!IMPORTANT]
You **do** get the full functionality of SteamInput, _without having to launch your games from Steam_  
For this Steam must still be running in the background, though.   
**Alternatively** SISR also has an **even more _experimental_** **no-Steam mode**, but it isn*t really the intended use-case.

> [!CAUTION]
If you are a Youtuber, and intend cover this software (aside from just mentioning it), **consider talking to me first**  
You are not required to, but I'd greatly appreciate it.  <br />  
  -The software is an active WIP, not ready for wide usage, with a bigger update in the next few days.  
 -I want to avoid people with significant reach stating false information.    
 -If something is unclear, I'm happy to help and/or improve my documentation
